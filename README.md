# Car Movment Example

Moving a car on maps like UBER with car marker rotating angles when the car is about to shift left or right simulating real world driving. 

This example is made using google maps but it can be implemented with Apple Maps too . 


The project size is not that big , it's actually < 1 MB, however i added the google maps frameworks to ensure version compatiblity with the app .
